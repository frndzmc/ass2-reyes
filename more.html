                A museum (from the Greek mouseion, which denotes a place or temple dedicated to the Muses) houses 
                important historical artifacts for public viewing. Museums have a long history, 
                dating back to Ancient Greece. Many early museums were private, established by wealthy 
                individuals, and later made public. 
                <br>
                <br>
                There are different types of museums all over the world, such as fine arts, applied arts, craft, 
                archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, history, 
                cultural history, military history, science, technology, children's museums, natural history,
                 numismatics, botanical and zoological gardens, and philately. Many are famous landmarks, 
                 including the Louvre, in Paris, the British Museum, and the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister 
                 Museum in Dresden, Germany. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                The purpose of a museum is to protect and conserve the different 
                 artifacts that represent human history throughout the world, for the sake of human knowledge, 
                 understanding, and enjoyment of the beauty and wisdom of those of different cultures.
